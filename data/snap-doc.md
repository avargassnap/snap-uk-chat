## 🛍️ 1. Point-of-Sale Financing

When a customer shops at a participating retailer, they can apply for financing through Snap. Once approved, Snap pays the store directly, and the store completes the transaction. In return, the store pays Snap a commission known as the **MDR** (Merchant Discount Rate).

## 💸 2. Customer Loan Options

Customers enter into a loan agreement with Snap, choosing from terms such as **18, 24, or 36 months**. These installment loans include interest, with monthly payments tailored to suit the customer’s budget.

Each loan has a fixed annual interest rate, and customers can see exactly how much they’ll pay over time.

---

## 🧾 3. “Pay in 4” (0% Interest)

Snap offers a **Pay-in-4** plan for qualifying purchases. This allows the customer to split their purchase into **four equal payments** over time — with **no interest**, as long as all payments are made on schedule.

If the customer misses payments, the agreement may convert into a longer-term interest-bearing loan.

## ✅ 4. Inclusive Eligibility

Snap’s mission is to make financing available to customers who may not be eligible through traditional credit systems. Applications are processed online, and Snap considers a broad range of credit backgrounds.

---

## 📆 5. Flexible Repayment Schedules

Customers can choose a repayment term that fits their financial situation:

- 18 months
- 24 months
- 36 months

Longer terms reduce monthly payments but increase the total repayable due to interest. Snap offers full transparency about terms and repayment totals.
